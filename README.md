### . ݁˖ Node Notes ✎ ✉︎. ݁₊

Hi! This is a simple command-line notes application built with **Node.js** as part of my 10th Guided Inquiry for learning backend JavaScript fundamentals.

The app lets users create, read, update, list, and delete notes that are stored locally in a JSON file.

### ᝰ🖋️ About This Project

This project was built while following Sections 3–5 of _The Complete Node.js Developer Course_ by Andrew Mead on Udemy. I utilized this project to practice core Node.js concepts such as modules, the file system, asynchronous JavaScript, and working with external npm packages.

All note data is saved to a local `notes.json` file.

### ᝰ🖋️ Prefer not to use the terminal ?

If you'd rather interact with Node Notes visually instead of using command-line commands, I created a simple web-based demo that uses the same core logic.

The live demo allows you to :

- view all notes in browser
- add new notes using a form
- read, edit, and delete notes visually
- see how the logic translates into a web interface
